        <h1>How Have Hate Crimes Trended in the Last Decade in New York?</h1>
        <h2 class="subheader"> Awareness of attacks on various characteristics of identity has increased in recent years, with society becoming generally more welcoming to self-expression and plenty of legislation passed. However, hate crimes against particular identities have risen in recent years and are only perpetuated by the anonymity of social media.

      <img class="story_image" src="https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GettyImages-1231879242-1800x1200-c-default.jpg">  
      

      <p>In the last decade, we have seen an increased level of dialogue and legislative progress seeking to create an America where people of all identities can feel included and cared for. As always in American politics, this has become a divisive topic and therefore sparked an inverse rise of hate and backlash. This antagonism from ignorant people is perpetuated by the recent rise in popularity of social media, where many of the platforms are entirely anonymous. Hate crime is an issue that American society has become increasingly aware of in recent years, and using hate crime report data and information, we can understand hate crimes regarding particular sections of identity have trended in the last decade.</p>

      <p>In the past, hate crimes were often ignored or dismissed as isolated incidents. However, in recent years, there has been greater recognition of the harm that hate crimes can cause, both to the individuals targeted and to society as a whole. However, the rise of social media and other online platforms has made it easier for individuals to spread hate and target others based on their personal characteristics. As a result, hate crimes have become more widespread and more difficult to combat.</p>

      <p>An example that has become increasingly common in the past decade is hate targeted toward members of the LGBTQ community. As society has progressed to encourage people to feel comfortable in expressing themselves, it has enabled many people to break free from gender and sexuality norms, yet many still feel the need to cast negative opinions. Data from the New York Division of Criminal Justice shows recent increases in reported anti-gay and anti-transgender attacks. Understand that this data does come from only crimes which are reported, though various studies conclude that a majority of hate crimes go unreported.</p>

      <p>The impact of hate crimes on individuals and communities cannot be overstated. For those who are targeted, these crimes can cause significant emotional and psychological harm, and sometimes physical injury. For the community as a whole, hate crimes can create a sense of fear and anxiety, leading to increased tension and division. Many hate crimes are also often built on ludicrous stereotypes, worsening the divisions that already exist in the country.</p>

      <p>In response to the rise of hate crimes in New York and throughout the country, there has been a growing movement to address this issue. This includes efforts to increase awareness of hate crimes and to provide support to victims. It also includes increased efforts by law enforcement to investigate and prosecute hate crimes, as well as the implementation of new laws and policies designed to combat hate crimes. These laws range from national landmarks like the Marriage Equality Act in 2015, Title IX Protections in 2020, and the Transgender Military Ban Reversal in 2021, to New York legislation such as the Conversion Therapy Ban, and Gender Identity Non-Discrimination and Reproductive Health Acts of 2019.</p>

      <p>Hate crimes have had a significant impact on American society, the state of New York, and Syracuse University over the past decade. During the surge of COVID, hate crimes against people of Asian ethnicity skyrocketed due to negative media coverage and political divisiveness aimed mostly at China. As seen in the chart above, these crimes became a severe crisis in a short matter of time. In 2021, Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act which looked to combat hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.</p>

      <p>While awareness and legislation aimed at combating hate crimes have increased in recent years, hate crimes against particular identities have also risen. This rise can be attributed in part to the anonymity of social media, which has made it easier for individuals to spread hate and target others based on their personal characteristics. However, there is hope in the growing movement to address hate crimes, with increased awareness, support for victims, and efforts by law enforcement to investigate and prosecute these crimes. It is important to continue this work in creating a society where everyone feels included and cared for, free from hate and discrimination.</p>
